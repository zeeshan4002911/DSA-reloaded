"""
Given an integer n. Your task is to calculate the sum of all natural numbers from 1 up to n (inclusive). If n is 0, the sum should be 0.

Examples:

Input: n = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: The numbers from 1 to 3 are 1, 2, and 3. Their sum is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

Input: n = 5
Output: 15
Explanation: The numbers from 1 to 5 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Their sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(1)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
