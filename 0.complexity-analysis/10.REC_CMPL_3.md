###### What is the worst case time complexity of the following code :
```cpp
int memo[101][101];
int findMinPath(vector<vector<int> >& V, int r, int c) {
  int R = V.size();
  int C = V[0].size();
  if (r >= R || c >= C) return 100000000; // Infinity
  if (r == R - 1 && c == C - 1) return 0;
  if (memo[r][c] != -1) return memo[r][c];
  memo[r][c] =  V[r][c] + min(findMinPath(V, r + 1, c), findMinPath(V, r, c + 1));
  return memo[r][c];
}

// Callsite : 
memset(memo, -1, sizeof(memo));
findMinPath(V, 0, 0);
```

## *Solution*
### Time Complexity:

The key difference from the previous recursive solution is the addition of a memoization table (memo), which stores the results of subproblems so they don't need to be recomputed.

Memoization ensures that each subproblem (i.e., each grid position (r, c)) is solved only once. Once a result is computed for a specific grid position, it is saved in the memo table to avoid redundant calculations.

1. Recursive Calls:
   - Without memoization, the function would make an exponential number of calls since at each cell (r, c), it recursively explores two other cells: (r + 1, c) (down) and (r, c + 1) (right).
   - With memoization, each cell (r, c) is computed only once. Each recursive call checks the memoization table to avoid recomputing previously solved subproblems.

2. Number of Subproblems:
   - The total number of unique subproblems corresponds to the number of unique grid positions, which is R×C.
   - For each subproblem, we are only performing a constant amount of work: checking the memoization table and making at most two recursive calls.

3. Final Time Complexity:
   - Since there are R×C unique subproblems and each subproblem takes O(1) time to look up the result or compute and store the result, the total time complexity is: **O(R×C)**

### Space Complexity:

1. Memoization Table:  
    The memoization table memo stores the results for each cell in the grid, and its size is R×CR×C, so it takes O(R×C) space.

2. Recursion Stack:  
   The recursion depth is bounded by the size of the grid. In the worst case, the depth of recursion could be O(R+C) (when the path taken is along the grid's diagonal). Thus, the space complexity from the recursion stack is O(R+C)O(R+C).

3. Total Space Complexity:  
   The total space complexity is the sum of the space used by the memoization table and the recursion stack:  
   **O(R×C)+O(R+C)=O(R×C)**
