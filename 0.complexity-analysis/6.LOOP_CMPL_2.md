###### What is the time, space complexity of following code :
```cpp
    int i, j, k = 0;
    for (i = n/2; i <= n; i++) {
        for (j = 2; j <= n; j = j * 2) {
            k = k + n/2;
        }
    }
```
###### Assume that rand() is O(1) time, O(1) space function.

## *Solution*
### Time Complexity:

Outer for loop (i = n/2; i <= n; i++):  
The outer loop starts with i = n/2 and runs until i = n.  
So, the number of iterations of the outer loop is from n/2 to n, which results in approximately n/2 iterations.  
Therefore, the outer loop runs O(n) times (since n/2 is asymptotically O(n)).

Inner for loop (j = 2; j <= n; j = j * 2):  
The inner loop runs with j starting from 2 and doubling each time (j = j * 2), up to n.  
The condition for the inner loop is j <= n, and since j is doubled in each iteration, the number of iterations is determined by the number of times you can double 2 before it exceeds n.  
This is equivalent to the number of times we can divide nn by 2, which is approximately log⁡(n).  
Therefore, the inner loop runs O(log⁡n) times.

Inside the inner loop, the operation k = k + n/2 takes constant time, i.e., O(1).

Since the two loops are nested and depends on each other, the total time complexity is:  
O(n) x O(logn) = O(nlogn)

***Theta Notation (Θ-notation):***
Theta notation, Θ(f(n)), provides an asymptotically tight bound on the time complexity. It means that the time complexity grows at the same rate as f(n) both in the upper and lower bounds.

Since the time complexity is O(nlogn), the theta notation for this code is:  
Θ(nlog⁡n)

This means that the time complexity of this code grows at the rate of nlogn, and we can say with certainty that the algorithm's time complexity will be bounded both above and below by nlog⁡nnlogn for large n.

### Space Complexity:

Variables:  
The space used for i, j and k is constant, Θ(1).  
No additional data structures are used that grow with n.

Thus, the space complexity is:  
Θ(1)  

Summary:  
Time Complexity: Θ(nlogn)  
Space Complexity: Θ(1)
