###### What is the time, space complexity of following code :
```cpp
int j = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    while(j < n && arr[i] < arr[j]) {
        j++;
    }
}
```

## *Solution*
### Time Complexity:

- Outer Loop (for loop with i): This loop runs from i = 0 to i < n, so it executes n times.
- Inner Loop (while loop with j): Inside the for loop, there is a while loop where the index j increases as long as arr[i] < arr[j] and j < n.

The important observation is that the inner while loop's index j is not reset between iterations of the i loop. This means that once j is incremented, it continues incrementing in subsequent iterations of the outer loop.

Worst-case scenario: In the worst case, if arr[i] is always smaller than arr[j] for each iteration of the outer loop, the while loop will keep incrementing j until it reaches n. Hence, j will only increase once from 0 to n.

Thus, the inner while loop will run at most n times across all iterations of the for loop.

Hence, the total time complexity will be O(n)

### Space Complexity:

Variables:  
The space used for i and j are constant, O(1).  
No additional data structures are used that grow with n.

Thus, the space complexity is:  
O(1)  

Summary:  
Time Complexity: O(n)  
Space Complexity: O(1)
