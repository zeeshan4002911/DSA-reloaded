###### What is the time, space complexity of following code :
```cpp
    int a = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (j = N; j > i; j--) {
            a = a + i + j;
        }
    }

```

## *Solution*
### Time Complexity:

First for loop of nested loop (i = 0; i < N; i++):  
The outer loop runs N times, and inside for loop (j = N; j > i; j--) also run N times.  
Inside the inner for loop a is getting assigned with a + i + j which takes O(1) time  
So, the total time for the nested loop is O(NxN).

The total time complexity is:  
O(NxN)

### Space Complexity:

Variables:  
There is only one integer variables a, taking O(1) space.  
The space used for i, and j is also constant, O(1).  
No additional data structures are used that grow with N.

Thus, the space complexity is:  
O(1)  

Summary:  
Time Complexity: O(NxN)  
Space Complexity: O(1)
