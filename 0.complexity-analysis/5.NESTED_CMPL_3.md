###### What is the time, space complexity of following code :
```cpp
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = N; i > 0; i /= 2) {
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            count += 1;
        }
    }
```

## *Solution*
### Time Complexity:

Outer loop:  
The outer loop starts with i = N and halves i in each iteration (i /= 2).  
So, the value of i will be N, N/2, N/4, N/8, ... until i > 0.  
The number of iterations of the outer loop will be approximately log(N) because each time i is divided by 2.

Inner loop:  
For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs i times.  
Initially, i = N, so the inner loop runs N times in the first iteration of the outer loop.  
In the next iteration, i = N/2, so the inner loop runs N/2 times.  
This continues, with the inner loop running N/4, N/8, and so on, each time halving.

Total work:  
The total number of operations (i.e., the total iterations of the inner loop across all iterations of the outer loop) is:  
N + N/2 + N/4 + N/8 + ⋯

This is a geometric series, and the sum of an infinite geometric series with the first term NN and common ratio 1/21/2 is:  
S = N x (1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ⋯ ) = 2N

So, the total number of operations is O(N).

Time complexity:  
The time complexity of the code is O(N), because the total number of operations is proportional to N.

### Space Complexity:

Variables:  
There is only one integer variables a, taking O(1) space.  
The space used for i and j, and those are also constant, O(1).  
No additional data structures are used that grow with N.

Thus, the space complexity is:  
O(1)  

Summary:  
Time Complexity: N  
Space Complexity: O(1)
