###### What is the time, space complexity of following code :
```cpp
    int a = 0, i = N;
    while (i > 0) {
        a += i;
        i /= 2;
    }
```

## *Solution*
### Time Complexity:

The while loop starts with i = N and on each iteration it will get divided by 2 which basically reduce the size of input N to half.  
This is equivalent to the logarithm of N to the base 2 (i.e., log‚Å°2(N)).   
Assignment of a and division of i by 2 takes O(1) time.

The total time complexity is:  
O(logN)

### Space Complexity:

Variables:  
There is only one integer variables a, taking O(1) space.  
The space used for i, is also constant, O(1).  
No additional data structures are used that grow with N.

Thus, the space complexity is:  
O(1)  

Summary:  
Time Complexity: O(LogN)  
Space Complexity: O(1)
