###### What is the time, space complexity of following code :
```cpp
    int a = 0, b = 0; 
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) { 
        for (j = 0; j < N; j++) { 
            a = a + j; 
        } 
    } 
    for (k = 0; k < N; k++) { 
        b = b + k; 
    }
```

## *Solution*
### Time Complexity:

First for loop of nested loop (i = 0; i < N; i++):  
The outer loop runs N times, and inside for loop also run N times. Inside the inner for loop a is getting assigned with a + j which takes O(1) time  
So, the total time for the first nested loop is O(NxN).

Second for loop (j = 0; j < N; k++):  
The loop runs M times, and inside the loop assignment is happening for b, which also takes O(1) time.  
So, the total time for the second loop is O(N).

Since the two loops are independent and do not depend on each other (sequential execution), the total time complexity is:  
O(NxN)+O(N)=O(NxN)

### Space Complexity:

Variables:  
There are two integer variables a and b, each taking O(1) space.  
The space used for i, j and k is also constant, O(1).  
No additional data structures are used that grow with N or M.

Thus, the space complexity is:  
O(1)  

Summary:  
Time Complexity: O(NxN)  
Space Complexity: O(1)
