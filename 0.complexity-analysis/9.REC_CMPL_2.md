###### What is the worst case time complexity of the following code:
```cpp
int findMinPath(vector<vector<int> > &V, int r, int c) {
  int R = V.size();
  int C = V[0].size();
  if (r >= R || c >= C) return 100000000; // Infinity
  if (r == R - 1 && c == C - 1) return 0;
  return V[r][c] + min(findMinPath(V, r + 1, c), findMinPath(V, r, c + 1));
}
```
###### Assume R = V.size() and C = V[0].size().

## *Solution*

### Code breakdown:

The function findMinPath recursively finds the minimum path sum in a grid V from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. Here's how it works:  
Base Case:  
If the current position (r, c) is out of bounds (i.e., r >= R or c >= C), it returns a large value, which can be treated as "infinity" (used to prevent considering paths outside the grid).  
If the current position is the bottom-right corner (R-1, C-1), it returns 0 since there's no further path to take.

Recursive Case:  
At each step, the function adds the value V[r][c] to the minimum of two recursive calls:  
One call moves down (r + 1, c).  
One call moves right (r, c + 1).

This essentially computes the minimum path sum from the current position (r, c) to the destination (R-1, C-1).

### Time Complexity:

Recursive Tree:  
Each recursive call generates two further recursive calls, one moving right and one moving down.  
The recursion tree has a branching factor of 2 at each level, meaning the number of function calls increases exponentially as the recursion deepens.

To visualize this, consider a grid of size R×C. Starting from the top-left corner (0, 0), the recursive function explores two potential directions at each step (down or right). This continues until it reaches the bottom-right corner. Hence, the number of recursive calls grows exponentially with the grid size.

Total Number of Calls:  
The worst-case scenario occurs when the function explores all possible paths from (0, 0) to (R-1, C-1).  
The total number of recursive calls can be approximated by the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, which is the sum of all possible down and right moves (forming a path through a grid).  
This is equal to O(^(2R+C)) calls because at each step, the function has two choices (move down or move right), and there are R+C total moves in the worst case (since in the worst case, every call moves either down or right).

Since each recursive call takes constant time O(1) (except for the recursive calls themselves), the total time complexity is dominated by the number of recursive calls.
Therefore, the time complexity is O(2^(R+C)).

### Space COmplexity:

The primary space consumed by the recursive approach is the call stack due to the recursion.  
In the worst case, the recursion can travel the entire length of the grid. Since at each step it moves either right or down, the maximum depth of recursion is approximately R+C, and no auxiliary space is used.  
The only additional space used in each recursive call is the function's local variables, such as r, c, and mid, which take up constant space,   
Thus space complexity will be O(R+C)

## Optimization Consideration:

To improve the time complexity, dynamic programming or memoization can be used to store and reuse the results of subproblems, reducing the time complexity to O(R×C).

To optimize the findMinPath function using dynamic programming, we can use a bottom-up approach where we store the results of the subproblems in a table (a 2D array) and use these precomputed values to avoid redundant calculations.

Dynamic Programming Approach:  
1. Define a DP Table: We create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum path sum from cell (i, j) to the bottom-right corner (R-1, C-1).  
2. Recurrence Relation: The minimum path sum for each cell can be derived from the following:  
dp[i][j] = V[i][j] + min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1])  
This means that for each cell (i, j), the minimum path sum is the value of V[i][j] plus the minimum of the values of the cell directly below (i+1, j) and the cell directly to the right (i, j+1).  
3. Base Case: The base case is the bottom-right corner. The minimum path sum at (R-1, C-1) is simply V[R-1][C-1] because there are no further cells to move to.  
4. Fill the DP Table: We fill the table starting from the bottom-right corner and move towards the top-left corner.

*Solution with Dynamic Programming:*
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int findMinPath(vector<vector<int>> &V) {
    int R = V.size();
    int C = V[0].size();

    // DP table to store the minimum path sum
    vector<vector<int>> dp(R, vector<int>(C, 0));

    // Fill the dp table starting from the bottom-right corner
    dp[R - 1][C - 1] = V[R - 1][C - 1]; // Base case: bottom-right corner

    // Fill the last row (can only move right)
    for (int j = C - 2; j >= 0; --j) {
        dp[R - 1][j] = V[R - 1][j] + dp[R - 1][j + 1];
    }

    // Fill the last column (can only move down)
    for (int i = R - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
        dp[i][C - 1] = V[i][C - 1] + dp[i + 1][C - 1];
    }

    // Fill the rest of the dp table
    for (int i = R - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
        for (int j = C - 2; j >= 0; --j) {
            dp[i][j] = V[i][j] + min(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j + 1]);
        }
    }

    // The answer is the minimum path sum starting from the top-left corner
    return dp[0][0];
}

int main() {
    // Example grid
    vector<vector<int>> V = {
        {1, 3, 1},
        {1, 5, 1},
        {4, 2, 1}
    };

    cout << "Minimum path sum: " << findMinPath(V) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
### Explanation of the Solution:

1. Base Case: The minimum path sum at the bottom-right corner dp[R-1][C-1] is just the value V[R-1][C-1].
2. Fill the Last Row and Column:  
   - The last row (dp[R-1][j]) can only move right, so the value at each cell is the current cell value V[R-1][j] plus the value of the cell to its right.
   - The last column (dp[i][C-1]) can only move down, so the value at each cell is the current cell value V[i][C-1] plus the value of the cell below it.
3. Fill the Rest of the DP Table:  
   - For all other cells, the value at dp[i][j] is V[i][j] plus the minimum of the values from the cell below (dp[i+1][j]) and the cell to the right (dp[i][j+1]).
4. Final Answer: The minimum path sum starting from the top-left corner is stored in dp[0][0].

### Complexity:

Time Complexity: O(R×C)O(R×C), where RR is the number of rows and CC is the number of columns in the grid. This is because we fill every cell in the DP table exactly once.  
Space Complexity: O(R×C)O(R×C) for the DP table used to store the results.
