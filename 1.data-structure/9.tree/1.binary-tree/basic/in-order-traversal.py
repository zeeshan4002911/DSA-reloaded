"""
Given a root of a Binary Tree, your task is to return its Inorder Traversal.

Note: An inorder traversal first visits the left child (including its entire subtree), then visits the node, and finally visits the right child (including its entire subtree).

Examples:

Input: root = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output: [4, 2, 5, 1, 3]
Explanation: The inorder traversal of the given binary tree is [4, 2, 5, 1, 3].

Input: root = [8, 1, 5, N, 7, 10, 6, N, 10, 6]

Output: [1, 7, 10, 8, 6, 10, 5, 6]
Explanation: The inorder traversal of the given binary tree is [1, 7, 10, 8, 6, 10, 5, 6].

Constraints:
1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 3*10^4
0 ≤ node->data ≤ 10^5

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

"""
Inorder traversal is a depth-first traversal method that follows this sequence:

    Left subtree is visited first.
    Root node is processed next.
    Right subtree is visited last.
